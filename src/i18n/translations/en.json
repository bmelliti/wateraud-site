After years troubleshooting plants across Canada, our engineers noticed a pattern: projects rarely failed for lack of technology—they failed for lack of unbiased guidance. WaterAud fills that gap. We translate complex chemistry and vendor jargon into practical strategies, walking beside you from the first jar test to the final punch-list. Success, for us, means your water meets spec every day at the lowest lifecycle cost."
